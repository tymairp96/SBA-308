Learner Data Processor

This project is a solution to the SBA 308 assessment. It contains a JavaScript script that processes learner data, including submissions, to calculate a weighted average and individual assignment scores for each student.

The script also includes error handling for invalid data, such as a course ID mismatch or a division-by-zero scenario. It also accounts for late penalties on submissions.# SBA-308
